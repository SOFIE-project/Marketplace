Code and directory structure
============================

Since this is intended to be re-usable code, with the repository
containing sample stuff, we want to have a clear distinction between
these two code groups.

For this purpose the top-level project directory is structured as
follows:

* `sofie_offer_marketplace`

  this is the actual python package code

* `solidity`

  contains solidity code

* `examples`

  examples, including sample marketplace implementation and deployment
  scripts to make it possible to deploy the sample implementation
  easily on AWS

* `doc`

  Project documentation
